# Form_Filler_AutoBot
This is a web automation program that helps to fill in online forms given the preset database of information.

# About
This project uses selenium python to implement online form filling algorithm. The user makes a database of his common contact information/details like name, email id, phone no. etc and this is stored locally [ For privacy reasons ].

The program requires just one input the 'url link' of the form. The program then finds the respective fields and matches them to the database to fill them up. The program also informs the user if a particular field in the database was not found.

This saves a lot of time and human effort.

# Set up
The program requires prior installation of:
1) Selenium python
2) Python 3.0+
3) ChromeDriver

# Experimentation
I have created a google form for experimenting this program, here's the link if you want to try out: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5-ppmNgHVrixc1nk_U1CKdkLvqtPusSckg12DzdQRCuVVmw/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1

This form accepts multiple inputs, so you submit it as many times as you want. As the information is sent to me [the creator of the form], you might want to use fake information for privacy or well may be make your own google form. Have fun :)

# Note:
Updates on surpassing "I am not a robot" checks are on the way...
